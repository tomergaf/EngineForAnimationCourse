Changes:

%Assignment2 Project Added

%CollisionScene .h/.cpp hold defenition and logic respectively


-CollisionScene:

Built upon BasicScene1 from the first assingment. Now Supports Dynamic Collision Detection using OBB.
The Scene will showcase mesh's of bunnies colliding into eachother (one is moving and one is held in place)
and will reveal the smallest bounding
boxes which were involved.

ColisionScene contains 2 integral function:

1.ObjectsCollided - gets the 2 meshes checked for collision and their OBB tree.
  This is a recursive function propegates inside the trees and return true if 2 leafs 
  from the different trees colide, else false.

2.BoxesIntersect - gets as input 2 OBB boxes and 2 meshes. the function is responsible to determen
  if there was an intersection between the OBBs.
  If a separating axis is found (among the potential 15), the remaining ones will not be checked.
  The if statments correspond to the table as shown in the papers.
  
=============================
Other added functions:

%AnimateUntilCollision  - helper function that is used to determen the movement of the by using velocityX and velocityY
%StopMotion - velocityX, velocityY = 0
%UpdateYVelocity - uses a boolean parameter to determin the change of movement on thw Y axis
%UpdateXVelocity - uses a boolean parameter to determin the change of movement on thw X axis

==========
- Changed KeyCallback, now binding space up down left right to methods which change the velocity of the moving rabbit
	on the X and Y axis.
