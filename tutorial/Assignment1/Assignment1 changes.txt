Changes:

== Files Changed ==

- Added Assignment1 project , loads a local basic scene
- BasicScene.cpp/.h holds scene definition and logic

===================

** BasicScene **

++ Added ++

- decimationMult : a modifier to control how many edges are decimated
- clickmap that maps models in scene to mesh id to choose (based on space pressed or arrow keys)
- updateModelClickCount function that increases or decreases click according to key pressed
- PreDecimateMesh function to preprocess meshes into containing multiple mesh data objects with different levels of detail
  pass true for error approximation and false for shortest edge and midpoint
- custom collaps_edge
+++++++++++

%% Altered &&

-- Init
- loads and places four AutoMorphingModels in the scene :
	- a sphere
	- a cube
	- igl_fertility object
	- a cow
- initialized clickMap to 0 for all models in map
- defines morphing function: choose the mesh id for the picked model by predecimated mesh count modulo of click count for this model

-- PreDecimateMesh 
- initializes data structures for decimating meshes as described in libigl tutorial 703
- has a reset lambda resetting thos data structures 
- has a cut edges function that attempts to cut edges according to decimationMult using a weighted collapse edge function
- can choose between collapse functions with boolean flag : true for EA false for SEM
- runs a reset and then 10 attempts of cut edges, only successful attempts are added as meshes
- if running reset with true flag, will run computeQ for the algorithm to run properly
- change deciomationMult to increase or decrease edge count collapsed

-- KeyCallback
- listens to space presses: if an object is picked, this increases their click count
- listens to arrow up/down keys: if an object is picked, this increases or decreases their click count
- listens to r key: this resets all models click count
- this is not changed but remaains as requested: holding the right mouse button while moving object rotates it

-- UpdateModelClickCount
- this increases or decreases click count for selected model

-- custom collapse_edge function consists of:
- computeQ : Q matrices vector - matrix for each vertex with the algorithm's Q
- cost calculation - chosen by flag passed from calling function this utilizes the algorithm learned in class
- edge collapsing is igl's but using our algorithm as a cost function


-- DEBUG PRINTS
- uncomment the lines below "UNCOMMENT TO GET PRINTS" to get prints - this is commented as it slows run time
- collapses successful so far does not include collateral edges removed (other edges of adjoining faces removed)
